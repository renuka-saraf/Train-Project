# Train-Project

This is a C++ project that finds the shortest path between two stations in a train network. The project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and assumes that the train network can be represented as a weighted directed graph. We create a train network represented as a weighted directed graph with 6 stations. We then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between station 0 and station 5. The find_shortest_path function takes in the train network, the source.
The entire project is made in C++ to implement data structures in real world application.
